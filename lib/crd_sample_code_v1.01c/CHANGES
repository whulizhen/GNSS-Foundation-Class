====--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.01c of the CRD source code is now available on the ILRS web site.
This is a cleanup of all the errata entries since version 1.01b.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue #: 2015-1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 15 May 2015
Component: sample source code
Version: 1.01b
Routines: 
  crd_conv_slr_c/crd_to_merit.c
Problem:
In the case of the starting date in the header being late in one day, but 
the data records starting early in the next day, the day of year in the
Merit II file is wrong.
Change:
For record types 10, 11, and 20, use existing mechanism for testing for day 
roll-over to include a check between header and data record second of day.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue #: 2013-1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 22 JUn 2012
Component: sample source code
Version: 1.01b
Routines: 
crd_chk_c/crd_chk.c
Problem:
Program does not make use of return status to indocate data failure.
Program does not detect when there are too few end of data records. 
Change:
Add a "fail" code to provide non-zero return value when program fails due to
an error. Also, detect when there are fewer h8 records than h1 or h2 records.

====--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 23 February 2012
====--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.01b of the CRD source code is now available on the ILRS web site.
This is a cleanup of all the errata entries since version 1.01.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue #: 2012-1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2 Feb 2012
Component: sample source code
Version: 1.01b
Routines: 
  crd_conv_slr_c/read_cstg.c
  crd_conv_slr_c/read_merit.c
  crd_conv_llr_c/cllr_to_crd.c
Problem:
With some compilers versions, there is round off error in seconds of day 
read from the legacy formats. For cllr_to_crd.c, this is also true for time 
of flight.
Change:
Change all instances of "1.e7" in second of day calculations to 
"(long double)1.e7". In cllr_to_crd.c, also change "1.e13" tp 
"(long double)1.e13" in time of flight computations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue #: 2011-3
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2 Mar 2011
Component: sample source code
Version: 1.01b
Routines: 
  crd_conv_slr_c/cstg_to_crd.c
  crd_conv_slr_c/read_cstg.c
  crd_conv_slr_c/read_merit.c
  crd_split_c/merge_crd_daily.c

Problem:
The type of getifield returned value is long, but some variables used in the 
call to getifield are type int, resulting in problems with some compilers.
Change:
Changed the type of data_release and syear in crd_conv_clr_c programs and
ss, yy, ddd, hhmm, year, mon, day and sic in crd_split/merge_crd_daily.c 
to long.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue #: 2011-2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2 Mar 2011
Component: sample source code
Version: 1.01b
Routine: crd_conv_slr_c/cstg_to_crd.c
Problem 1:
Cannot distinguish native CRD files from those converted from legacy files
run through this converter.
Change 1:
Add comment to converted file to distinguish from native CRD creation. 
NOTE: User should change "site" to reflect their site or organization.
Problem 2:
Type of argument to calls to time and gmtime should be time_t but were long;
Change 2:
Changed the type of the argument (lclock) to time_t.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue #: 2011-1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 25 Jan 2011
Component: sample source code
Version: 1.01b
Routine: crd_chk_c/crd_chk.c
Problem:
Previous change for detecting issues with satellite identification printed
output at the end of the      program run, obscuring the source of the problem.
Also, program checked for strict time sequence, regardless of data record type.
However, meteorological and differnt data records need only to be in sequence
within their record type.

Change:
Print identification errors with the other errors from that pass. Check for
time out-of-sequence only within each record type. Also, remove/change records
in targets.dat having "0" for cospar/ilrs ID.

See the following files on the ILRS web site:
crd_chk.c_v1.01b
targets.dat

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: v1.01a was never put onto the ILRS web site as a separate tar file. 
v1.01 + errata through 2010-3 (1.01a) and through 2012-1 were rolled into 
v1.01b on the web site.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue #: 2010-3
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 09 Nov 2010
Component: sample source code
Version: 1.01a
Routine: crd_chk_c/crd_chk.c
Problem:
Program does not check that target ILRS ID, NORAD ID, SIC, name, and target
type agree. This has shown up when stations use non-standard target names on
the H3 record.

Change:
Apply the following difference file to crd_chk.c (v1.01). Add the file
targets.dat to the execution directory.

Note: If the diff file below is too difficult to use, please email
ricklefs@csr.utexas.edu for the full source code of the new version.

Issue #: 2010-2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 29 July 2010
Component: sample source code
Version: 1.01 (and 1.00)
Routine: crd_chk_c/crd_chk.c
Problem:
Crd_chk disallows a "-1" as the value for the rms of the system delay. There
are some instances where this value does not apply, and "-1" should be allowed.
In addition, checks of the skew, kurtosis, and peak-mean are absent from the
program.
Change:
Crd_chk.c line 733 should be changed from
          if (d40.cal_rms < 0 || d40.cal_rms > 1.e8)
to
          if (d40.cal_rms < -1 || d40.cal_rms > 1.e8)
. Missing checks will be added to the next release.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue #: 2010-1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 9 April 2010
Component: sample source code
Version: 1.01 (and 1.00)
Routine: common_c/write_crd.c
Problem:
The write_11 (normal point record) routine writes only 7 significant digits
in the seconds of day field. For consistency with other c and FORTRAN
routines, this routine should write 12 significant digits.
Change:
Replace line 172
           "11 %.7Lf %.12Lf %-s %d %.1f %d %.1f %.3f %.3f %.1f %.1f %d\n",
with
           "11 %.12Lf %.12Lf %-s %d %.1f %d %.1f %.3f %.3f %.1f %.1f %d\n",
.
Note: Stations are not requred to write 12 significant digits if the ranging
system performance does not warrant this accuracy. Please see the CRD format
manual for more information.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 29 October 2009
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.01 of the CRD manual and source code are now available on the ILRS
website.  Errata below have been rolled into the new version, and there are
other corrections and clarifications to the manual. There have been no format
changes in version 1.01, in the sense that there are no new additional records
or fields, nor have fields been moved or resized.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue #: 2009-13
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 10 October 2009
Component: manual
Version: 1.00
Section: 3 Data Records, and others
Problem: Analysts asked that the chronological ordering of records be clarified.
Change:
Replace the paragraph on order of records with the following. Changes were
made in several other places in the manual.
"Data records of the same type must be in chronological order. In other words,
all normal point records must be in chronological order; all meteorological
records must be in chronological order, etc. Meteorological records, for
instance, may be either interleaved with the normal point records or kept
together. Times assigned to the calibration (“40”) and session (“50”) records
are at the discretion of the station, although if there are multiple
calibration records in a pass, the times should be representative of the
time for which they are applicable."

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue #: 2009-12
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 10 October 2009
Component: manual
Version: 1.00
Section: 1.2.2 Notes section for station (H2) header record
Problem: It was discovered that the analysts can not handle any Station
Epoch Time Scale values except 3, 4, and 7 without throwing out the data.
Change:
Replace paragraph regarding "station epoch time scale":
"Currently, values of the  Station Epoch Time Scale other than 3, 4, and 7
will not be understood by the SLR data analysts, and data including them
will usually be discarded. Since time scales do evolve, and some experiments
require higher accuracies than are available with the current techniques,
it was necessary to include the possibility of new values (10-99) that did
not conflict with current or obsolete historical values. If you believe
there is a compelling reason to use another value (e.g. 10 or above) you
must propose the new value and explain the reasons to the ILRS Analysis
Working Group and the ILRS Data Formats and Procedures Working Group. If
they grant approval, you may use the new value, and it will be documented
in this manual."

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue #: 2009-11
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 18 August 2009
Component: sample source code
Version: 1.00
Routines: crd_to_merit.c
          crd_to_cstg_np.c
          crd_to_cstg_ql.c
These programs have had substantial changes to:
 1) accumulate and interpolate meteorological and point angle data, to handle
    CRD data files in which these record types are sent as blocks with the file.
 2) handle change of day in the middle of a pass (crd_to_merit.c); and
 3) properly handle data and terminate the program even if trailing "H9" record
    is not present.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue #: 2009-10
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 04 May 2009
Component: sample source code
Version: 1.00
Routine: crd_conv_slr_c/crd_to_cstg_np.c
Problem: When the "11" record return rate/ signal:noise field in a CRD file 
is set to -1 (not available), -1 is copied into the lunar signal:noise field 
of the CSTG normal point. This field should be '00' in the CSTG normal point.
Change:
After line 261, insert
              if (d11.return_rate < 0) np.snr= 0;

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue #: 2009-9
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 04 May 2009
Component: sample source code
Version: 1.00
Routine: crd_chk_c/crd_chk.c
Problem: Crd_chk correctly finds and reports errors when there are non-blanks in
header H3 column 23. However it reports the error is in column 22.
Change:
Replace line 227
          nh3_bl[i++] = 22;
with
          nh3_bl[i++] = 23;
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue #: 2009-8
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 04 May 2009
Component: sample source code
Version: 1.00
Routine: crd_chk_c/crd_chk.c
Problem: Crd_chk gives an "out of sequence" error when time of day wraps 
around to 0. (See Issue #2009-7)
Change:
At lines 699, 666, 631, 600, 577, 541, and 496, replace
          if (test_sec_of_day < last_sec_of_day)
with
          if (test_sec_of_day < last_sec_of_day &&
              (last_sec_of_day - test_sec_of_day) < 80000)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue #: 2009-7
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 04 May 2009
Component: manual
Version: 1.00
Section: 3. Data Records
Problem: There is no explicit statement as to whether second of day is allowed
to exceed 86400 or required to wrap around to 0 at end of day.
Change:
Add paragraph before section 3.1 -
  Seconds of day are, at least for the time being, modulo 86400. In other 
  words, seconds of day must wrap around to 0 at the end of day. Using the
  pass start and stop time from the H4 header, it will be possible to 
  unambiguously determine the day associated with the second of day. To remove
  any ambiguity, the satellite pass must not be longer than 1 day (which could 
  occur for geostationary satellites).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue #: 2009-6
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 12 March 2009
Component: manual
Version: 1.00
Section: Introduction
Problem: The manual suggests filling a numeric field with "-1" and a string 
field with "na" the when value is not known or not applicable when converting 
from old format. These should be the fallback values in all cases, not just 
when converting old data.
Change:
Replace
  When data is converted from an old format to the CRD format, there will be 
  fields (such as skew and kurtosis) that do not exist in the old format.
with
  There will often be cases where the value of a data record field is either 
  unknown or not applicable. This is especially true when data is converted 
  from an old format to the CRD format, since there will be fields (such as 
  skew and kurtosis) that do not exist in the old format.
